# Pf2e Inquisitor Class

The Inquisitor Class based on u/AchantionTT's port of the Pathfinder 1e class
(https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/ycT8B2op-class-inquisitor-v2-0)

The module changes some Inquisitor features slightly to make Foundry automation easier.

This module does not include the Omdura and Living Grimoire class archetypes because my players were not interested in using them.
