# Pf2e Inquisitor Class

The Inquisitor class based on u/AchantionTT's Pathfinder 1e port.<br>
(https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/ycT8B2op-class-inquisitor-v2-0)<br>
Some  Inquisitor features were changed compared to the original homebrew document to make Foundry automation easier.

The module includes an import file for the premium version of Pathbuilder 2e<br>

The Omdura and Living Grimoire class archetypes are not included because my players were not interested in using them.<br>
