# Pf2e Inquisitor Class

The Inquisitor class based on u/AchantionTT's Pathfinder 1e port.

Some  Inquisitor features were slightly changed compared to the original homebrew document to make Foundry automation easier.

This module does not include the Omdura and Living Grimoire class archetypes because my players were not interested in using them.
